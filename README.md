# Movie review classifier
 Using RNNs to classify positive and negative reviews based on words and phrases

 The model utilizes the IMDB (common keras dataset used in machine learning) to demonstrate the use of RNN models with classification tasks. the dataset is used as an example, but the functions can be tranfered to several datasets and different problems with minimal or no changes.

 RNNs are capable of undestanding context of parameters. Each neuron, besides having a bias and a weight added to itself, has a new entry compared to MLPs and CNNs, the input of past neurons to base its decision. This method shows the network that the features are linked to each other and not independent to be classified individually. It can be used in videos, sound waves, and NLP.

## Development setup

 To use the algorithm it will be necessary some libraries, such as:

```sh
keras
matplotlib
```
